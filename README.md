# anilist-jimaku-button

This script adds a button to [AniList](https://anilist.co/) anime pages, linking straight to the corresponding [Jimaku](https://jimaku.cc/) entry.
- Note: The ID for the Jimaku entry is retrieved using the Jimaku API, so a Jimaku API key is required to use the script.

### Instructions

1. Install a user script manager such as Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey.
2. Install the script through Greasy Fork [here](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/493476-anilist-jimaku-button), or manually download the `.js` file and import the script into your user script manager.
    - If you install through Greasy Fork you will have the option to receive future updates automatically.
3. When you first install the script and visit an anime page on AniList, you will be prompted to enter your Jimaku API key.
    - You can generate an API key from your profile page on [Jimaku](https://jimaku.cc/) after creating an account.
4. Once the API key is entered, the Jimaku button will appear on the page.
    - Note: if Jimaku does not have an entry corresponding to the AniList ID for that page, the button will link to the Jimaku homepage instead.
